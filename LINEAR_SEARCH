	Describing this lets do by taking a example of searching books in shelf,suppose you have 6 books namely A B C D E F ,and u need to search for book D then u will search from left to right.As you are searching linearly hence this is called linear search algorithm..

Procedure : LINEAR_SEARCH(A,n,x)
Input : A - array
        n - number of elements in array A
        x - element to be searched

Ouput - If A[i]=x,return i as output ,else return Not Found

Steps :
      1.Return answer as NOT_FOUND 
      2.for i to n,
         if A[i]=x,then set answer to i and return i
      3.Return the value as answer as output.
